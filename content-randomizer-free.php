        <div style="text-align:left;">
            <p>This plugin randomly shuffles content around in an article using a simple short code to create dynamic articles and pages that change on each visit.</p>
            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            <p>With the free version, you are limited to 2 items per random set and articles/page with 200 or fewer words.</p>
            <p>Please do not edit the values in this plugin unless you know what you are doing. If you want more features, please consider upgrading to one of our paid versions, which includes FULL support for installing the plugin and any bugs you may encounter.

            <h3>How To Use</h3><ol>
            <li>Create or edit an article and write it as you would normally.</li>
            <li>When you want to randomize a word or phrase, type "[gen]" and then begin listing your keywords, separated with the "|" character. End the short code with a closing "[/gen]".</li>
            <li>Repeat for each keyword or phrase you want to randomly generate.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Example</h3>
            <div style="float:left;width:49%;box-sizing:border-box;padding:5px;background:#FAFAFA;">
                <b>Input:</b><br>
                <code>My [gen]favorite|least favorite[/gen] color is [gen]blue|the color of the sky[/gen].<br /><br /></code>
            </div>
            <div style="float:right;width:49%;box-sizing:border-box;padding:5px;background:#FAFAFA;">
                <b>Potential Output:</b><br>
                <code>My least favorite color is blue.</code><br>
                <code>My favorite color is the color of the sky.</code><br>
                <code>My favorite color is blue.</code>
            </div>
            <div style="clear:both;"></div>
            <h3>Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Quickly randomizes entire words or phrases you designate with the short code (see example).</li>
                <li>HTML support. Anything you wrap in the shortcode is randomized, including HTML tags.</li>
                <li>Nothing to configure. Turn it on and start generating unique content quickly!</li>
            </ul>
